## Imortance of credit risk assessment:

In 2023, corporate defaults soared with a record 153 cases, up 80% from the previous year. Consumer sectors and distressed exchanges were primary contributors, highlighting regions and industries under financial strain (S&P Global).

Moreover, three U.S. healthcare companies—Radiology Partners, Pluto Acquisition, and a third unnamed—defaulted on their debts in early 2024, marking the highest default rate since the 2008 financial crisis (Nairametrics).

Granting loans to applicants deemed 'high-risk' constitutes the most significant source of financial losses, known as credit loss. This loss occurs when a borrower fails to repay or absconds with the money owed.

The primary goal is to pinpoint these high-risk loan applicants so that the incidence of such loans, and consequently the resultant credit losses, can be minimized. This case study focuses on the identification of such candidates through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

An analysis will be conducted to determine the key factors influencing loan defaults. Understanding these determinant variables will enable the company to better manage its portfolio and assess associated risks. Recent instances of credit defaults, such as those reported in various financial sectors over the past few months, underscore the importance of this analysis in mitigating potential losses.

## Company Information

Lending Club, a peer-to-peer lending company based in the United States, was reviewed. Here, investors fund potential borrowers and earn profits based on the risks associated with the borrower's credit score. The company serves as a bridge between investors and borrowers.

## Lending Club Operations

An outline of how Lending Club operates was examined, detailing the process from loan application to decision-making based on the borrower's profile. Risks associated with the decision on whether or not to approve a loan were discussed:
A potential loss of business if a likely-to-repay applicant is not approved.
A financial loss for the company if a loan is approved for an applicant likely to default.

## Data Exploration

The dataset containing information on past loan applicants and their default statuses was analyzed to identify patterns indicating the likelihood of default. This analysis aids in making informed decisions such as denying loans, adjusting loan amounts, or modifying interest rates for high-risk applicants.

## Use of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was employed to understand how attributes of consumers and loans influence default tendencies.

## Tools and Libraries Utilized

A variety of Python libraries were used for data analysis including TensorFlow, Pandas, Seaborn, NumPy, and Matplotlib, alongside Plotly for enhanced visual explorations.
Techniques such as Bivariate analysis were applied to address imbalances in the dataset, ensuring a more accurate and representative analysis.

## Insights and Observations

Through the exploration, significant insights into the distribution of loan amounts, the impact of the economic environment on lending, and the regional distribution of loans were drawn.
The risk associated with different types of loans was assessed, providing a business perspective on potential financial implications.

## Conclusion

The analytical process culminated in a structured understanding of the interplay between consumer financial behavior and loan default risks, highlighting the critical role of credit scores and income levels in risk assessment strategies.
